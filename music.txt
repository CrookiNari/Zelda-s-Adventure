the engine just loops .ogg files to their beginning as soon as they end. If you want an intro that doesn't get looped, you'll have to do the other filetype. Or better yet, just change the music in Sol.audio.on_music_finished or whatever.

You can just export any music from audacity for example as a .ogg, and while you're exporting it it'll give you options to fill in some tags. Idk if a LOOPSTART tag is a default field, so you might need to do some more research.

it's not a default tag, but you can setup freely tags in audacity. the more difficult will be to define the exact sample where the loop starts. there are some tricks to get the right moment. make audacity timeline in samples instead of seconds, that's the first thing to do. Then, identify on the wave diagram where your loop starts/ends. Where you're in, zoom a LOT to clearly see just a line of the sound instead of the "wavy stuff". Your goal will be to get the exact sample where the line pass by the 0. If you cut at a moment where the line is not on 0, you'll have a strange artefact. you can test your loop on audacity by setting the start and end on the timepicker in the bottom of the gui. then you do the calculation to get the sample of the starting and ending point of the loop, and you report them in the tag. i can't be more precise, because i'm not expert myself and can't guarantee this method is 100% thrusty, but it will get you close enough i think. 

If youre not actually composing a song in audacity, and I don't know why you would be because that sounds awful lol, you should be able to see the timecode of the bar where you want to loop in your DAW. Like if I have a 4 bar intro, Id look at the timecode where bar 5 starts. Also, I think in audacity you can set your BMP and time signature and then show measures and beats instead of just hour:minute:second, not sure how to do that but it's just a Google away. Other option is like Renkeniko describes, pausing at the right second and zooming in so the loop starts at a place where the waveform is crossing the 0 line. No matter how you loop though, you have to keep in mind any instruments with reverb on them, the reverb is going to be just CUT immediately if you loop like this- one strategy I use to deal with this is if say, there's a viola playing a part at the end of a track, I will make sure there's at least one viola note playing at the beginning of the track so it doesn't just cut out with no reverb. Or maybe start the track (or place where the loop starts) with a big percussive thing to hide any weird transition. Or just loop to a place where right before the loop starts, the note was the same as where the loop ends, so the decay of the reverb will match. generally the loop moment is always safe to recut because it is setup to loop (except if you take a random song not video-game-planned). The 0 cross-line hint allow you to have no sound at this exact moment normally, so the silent should be good enough to start again (well, it's all a matter of try-and-retry in the end ^^)
