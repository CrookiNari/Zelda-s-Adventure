In a land far from the kingdom of Hyrule live
the peaceful people of Tolemac. One day, the evil
forces of Ganon invaded, and though the people
resisted valiantly, it was all in vain.
The seven celestial signs which protected the
land were stolen, paving the way to its downfall.
Even Link, the greatest Hyrulean warrior,
was no match for Ganon and was captured.
So it falls to another to take on the role of the
brave warrior that Tolemac so desparately needs.
I found a champion of strength and courage in the
wise and beautiful Princess Zelda.
Go now, aided by the Triforce of Wisdom,
and reclaim the signs and return peace to Tolemac!
